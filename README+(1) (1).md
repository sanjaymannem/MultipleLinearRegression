## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

- What is the background of your project?
    Usin multiple LinearRegression, we need to buil a model to know which independent varable is effecting the dependent variable
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
    Need findout the following
    Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    How well those variables describe the bike demands
- What is the dataset that is being used?
    data.csv

## Conclusions
- Temp, Season and weekday seems to be contributing significantly towards explaining the demand of the shared bikes.


## Technologies Used
- Sklearn, pandas, statsmodel, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
